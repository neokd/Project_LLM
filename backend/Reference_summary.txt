A Harvard team, led by Professor Mikhail Lukin, has achieved a significant milestone in quantum computing by creating a programmable, logical quantum processor capable of encoding up to 48 logical qubits and executing hundreds of logical gate operations. This development marks the first demonstration of large-scale algorithm execution on an error-corrected quantum computer, paving the way for early fault-tolerant and reliably uninterrupted quantum computation. The research, published in Nature, leverages a quantum computing architecture known as a neutral atom array, showcasing the potential for transformative benefits in science and society.
