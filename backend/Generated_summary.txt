A Harvard team has successfully created a programmable, logical quantum processor capable of encoding up to 48 logical qubits and executing hundreds of logical gate operations, marking a key milestone in the quest for stable and scalable quantum computing. Their system is the first demonstration of large-scale algorithm execution on an error-corrected quantum computer, heralding the advent of early fault-tolerant or reliably uninterrupted quantum computation. The breakthrough builds on years of work on a neutral atom array, pioneered in Lukin's lab and now being commercialized by QuEra. With their logical quantum processor, the researchers demonstrate parallel, multiplexed control of an entire patch of logical qubits using lasers. The work was supported by multiple funding agencies and companies.
